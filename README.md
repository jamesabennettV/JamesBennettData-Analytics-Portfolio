## James Bennett - Data Analytics Portfolio
Hi! My name is James! I have a background in analytical and critical thinking with my Bachelor's Degree in Philosophy from UC Berkeley. I have developed a strong framework of tools to explicate nuanced ideas and information into simpler key points for stakeholders. Overtime, I've grown to develope a passion in using data to uncover new insights purely from my own curiosity. And I am estatic to bring my analytic and critical thinking skills to the world of data as an entry-level data specialist. 

This portfolio is for me to showcase my data analytics projects that I've been working on for the last several months.

During my studies, I have refined my ability to consisely find not only key, but meaningful insights that stakeholders ought to know. I've also developed my skills in working with complex real-world data and approaches to track key patterns and trends. 

On my free time, I like to watching video essays and analytical videos to find an answers in media with real world context.
